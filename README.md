# minecraft-bash-launcher
Minecraft Launcher originally written in bash after reverse-engeneering the minecraft auth protocall from the wiki info. Includes little JSON parser from somewhere on the internet (forget where/who I got it from, sorry!)
Too lazy to find the script on my linux partition ATM, will get it up soon
